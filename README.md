# Chinese Vocab Review Site

This is a project I made to help me learn/relearn Chinese through translating the show Community.

This project should not be used unless you have prior Chinese experience because it does not contain basic words like "æˆ‘".
Alternatively, other vocabulary sets can be changed through the 'Chinese Vocab Community.xlsx' file. 

App.py runs a Flask web app locally. Currently features only a flashcard mode (chronological review and search coming soon).


TODO:
- clean and add requirements.txt
- search
- secure

This is my first attempt at web development so its neither optimal nor clean.
