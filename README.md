# Chinese Vocab Review Site

This is a project I made to help me learn/relearn Chinese through translating the show Community.

This project should not be used unless you have prior Chinese experience because it does not contain basic words like "æˆ‘".
Alternatively, other vocabulary sets can be changed through the 'Chinese Vocab Community.xlsx' file. 

App.py runs a Flask web app locally. Includes a flashcard move (`/flashcard`), chronological mode (`/reader`), and analytics (`/analyitcs`) - search/filters coming soon.

PinYin training in the works.

TODO:
- search
- secure

This is my first attempt at web development so its neither optimal nor clean.

**This app is configured for DEBUG mode and therefore should not be public facing unless that setting is altered**
