# Chinese Vocab Review Site

This is a project I made to help me learn/relearn Chinese through translating the show Community.

This project should not be used unless you have prior Chinese experience because it does not contain basic words like "æˆ‘".
Alternatively, other vocabulary sets can be changed through the 'Chinese Vocab Community.xlsx' file. 

App.py runs a Flask web app locally and will probably become the main version.


TODO:
- implement reader mode
- implement UI
- implement success statistics (self determined)
- clean and add requirements.txt
- secure

This is my first attempt at web development so its neither optimal nor clean.
