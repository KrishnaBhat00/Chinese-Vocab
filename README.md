# Chinese Vocab Review Site

This is a project I made to help me learn/relearn Chinese through translating the show Community.

This project should not be used unless you have prior Chinese experience because it does not contain basic words like "æˆ‘".
Alternatively other vocabulary sets can be changed through the 'Chinese Vocab Community.xlsx' file. 

Running site.py will locally run a site that allows for vocab review.


TODO:
- properly implement vocab set
- implement UI
- implement success statistics (self determined)
- clean and add requirements.txt
- secure

This is my first attempt at web development so its probably neither optimal nor clean.
